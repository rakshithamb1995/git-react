Javascript - JS is used to make web application very intaeractive and dynamic
Javascript is a scripting language which can be used in client side (Javascript) and server side (Node js)
Programming Language will use compiler
and Scripting Language will use interpreter to execute the code
interpreter will execute the code line by line

Where will use Javascript?
-Javascript is everywhere
-client side
-server side
-mobile applications (React Native, ionic)
-Desktop applications
Javascript can be write inside script tag

Variables- used to store information
Variable naming convention - 
1. cannot starts with numbers
2. cannot give space between variable name
3. cannot give special characters except $ and _
4. cannot giv reserved key words like var
Variable value naming convention
1.camelcasing(firstName)
